Question 01::
write an application that calculates the product
of the odd integers from 1 to 15.


Question 02:
Write method distance to calculate the distance between two
points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). All numbers and return values should be of type double. Incorporate
this method into an application that enables the user to enter the coordinates of the points.


Question 03:
(Fibonacci Series) The Fibonacci series
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â€¦
begins with the terms 0 and 1 and has the property that each succeeding term is the sum of the two
preceding terms.
a) Write a method fibonacci(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Incorporate
this method into an application that enables the user to enter the value of n.
b) Determine the largest Fibonacci number that can be displayed on your system.
c) Modify the application you wrote in part (a) to use double instead of int to calculate
and return Fibonacci numbers, and use this modified application to repeat part (b).

Question 04:

Drivers are concerned with the mileage their automobiles get. One driver has
kept track of several trips by recording the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. Develop
a c++ application that will input the miles driven and gallons used (both as integers) for each trip.
The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and print the
combined miles per gallon obtained for all trips up to this point. All averaging calculations should
produce floating-point
